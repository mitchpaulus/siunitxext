# siunitxext
Extended siunitx package for Latex. This package includes English (I-P) units among others. 

I became exhausted always adding units to the excellent siunitx package. 
As an American, we still, unfortunately, live in the IP unit system, impacting the usefulness of siunitx. 

If there is an esoteric unit that you would like to see added, please fork and make a pull request or message me directly!
