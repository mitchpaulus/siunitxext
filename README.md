# siunitxext Extended siunitx package for Latex. 
This package includes English (I-P) units among others. 

I became exhausted always adding units to the excellent siunitx package.
As an American, we still, unfortunately, live in the IP unit system,
impacting the usefulness of siunitx. 

If there is an esoteric unit that you would like to see added, please
fork and make a pull request or message me directly! 

# How to use

At the current moment, the package is not in CTAN. You'll have to
download the file and put into your Latex directly. Then call

```
\usepackage{siunitxext}
```
